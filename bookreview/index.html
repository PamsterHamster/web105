    <H1>The Institute Review</H1>
    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p><strong>The Institute </strong> book by <em>Stephen King</em> is his latest psychological
        thriller (2019) about a mysterious operation (is it government-run? Corporate-run or other?)
        shrouded in mystery and evil. Whatever this is, abuducts selected children by first
        killing their parents, then taking these children to an unknown, hidden remote location.
        Their kidnapping is plotted to make it look like the kids murdered the parents before
        making themselves disappear.
    </p>
    <p>The children wake-up into their new nightmare facing people who run all types of invasive
        tests on them. There are a few other kids on the premises, but eventually all will be put
        into the "Back Half", never to be seen again.
    </p>
    <p>The children deduce that they were chosen because they had previously (likely unknonwingly)
        demonstrated supernatual abilities on some level, though uncontrolled and not practiced in any disciplinary
        manner. Whatever/Whoever this evil represents wants to test/develop/use their powers for some 
        reason only known to the select adults involved.

    <h2>Main Characters: The Children</h2>
    <p><em>Luke Ellis</em> </p>
    <p>Luke is the primary central character. He's genius-level smart, who was going to attend both MIT 
        and Emerson college in the Fall-at the age of 12. Luke lived on Wildersmoot Drive in Minneapolis 
        prior to his abduction to the Inistitute. He is a TK (tele-kinetic). He sums up the oppresive life
        in the Institute by stating <q><em>This place will knock the bitch out of her. 
            Pretty soon she'll be scurrying and flinching every time she sees a guy in a blue top. 
            Just like the rest of us.</em></q>
    </p>
    <p><em>Kalisha (aka Sha)</em></p>
    Sha is a spunky African-American teenager who is the first to befriend Luke upon arrival.
    <p><em>Avery Dixon</em></p>
    <p>Avery is six years old and from Orem, Utah. He is a very strong telepathic (TP).</p>
    <p><em>Helen</em></p>
    <p>Helen is a spunky teen with a developed body and green hair. She doesn't take sass from
        anybody and uses her body to get her way. Luke is infatuated with her.
    </p>
    <p><em>Nicky</em></p>
    <p>Nicky is a wild and unpredictable teen who often gets himself into trouble with the other
        kids and staff. He's mouthy and often uncooperative, though his remarks are sometimes very
        humorous.
    </p>
    <p><em>Harry Cross</em></p>
    <p>Harry is about 16 years old and clearly a bully, but the other kids quickly put him in his place.</p>
    <p><em>Greta and her identical twin sister</em></p>
    <p>These two are the latest characters to have just arrived at the Institute. I'm not far enough in my 
        reading to know anything about them yet. </p>
    </p>
    <p><em>George, Iris, and others</em></p>
    <h3>What You Need To Know:</h3>
    <!-- I don't want to give away any spoilers -->
    <p>All "Institute" children come in and eventually leave to the Back Half, never to be heard from again. 
        Will anyone ever figure out what's happening in here? Or, like in Stephen King's <em>It</em>, is 
        it true that sometimes evil does win? I can't divulge that information yet, as I'm still fairly early on
        reading this 561-page riveting book.
