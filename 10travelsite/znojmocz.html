        <h2>Why Znojmo?</h2>
        <img src="02churchview2znojmo.jpg" alt="church view znojmo" style="float: right;">
        <p>Znojmo is located in the southeastern region of Moravia, about 54km/34miles from Brno,
            near the Austrian border and is situated on the bank of the
            Thaya (Dyje) River. As of 2019, approximately 34,000 people live in the city.
            The area is known for wine vineyards and is host to many festivals (wine, art, music, etc.),
            usually located in the city center.
            <br>
            <br>
            If you love wine, come during the designated weekend in September for the famous wine festival,
            where guests can purchase a punch pass and sample 20+ wines grown in the region. The local
            wine specialty is Burcak (harvested from young, fermented grapes). Lots of other festival
            activities will be going on simultaneously. The upcoming wine festival dates are
            September 11-13, 2020.</p>

        <p>If historical sites are more your speed, then know Znojmo dates back to the Medevial times. The local
            castle dates back to the 12th century. Nearby is the stone Romanesque Rotunda of Saint Catherine,
            also dating back to the 12th century (more than 600 years before the
            discovery of the USA). The inside is covered with still in-tact frescoes depicting
            various biblical scenes. </p>
        <p> Another popular tourist activity based on the cityâ€™s natural history is to explore the
            underground labyrinth of catacombs. It holds some very dark secrets.</p>
