                Work from home</h2>
            <p>You keep your job and are able to work from home via online technology.
                It sounds like paradise, right? There's no commute, you save on gas money,
                you can sleep in a bit, more time at the end of the day for freetime...
                What could possibly go wrong?

            <h2>The Pandemic Effect on the Average Joe</h2>
            <p>The sudden shelter-in-place orders at Federal and State levels due to the COVID-19 pandemic
                quickly bring life to a halt as we had previously known it. The COVID-19 virus is for real, highly
                contagious,
                with a pathology unknown...causing scientists to scramble for answers, frontline healthcare
                workers to be consistently at risk on the job, many workers furloughed and/or suddenly unemployed,
                and for those fortunate enough to keep their jobs, having to work from home doing everything in
                a remote fashion. The world suddenly finds themselves in a state of a 'new normal', one which
                came suddenly, abruptly, and accompanied with stressful consequences; both financially and
                psychologically.</p>
            <p>For those fortunate enough to work from home, one of the major challenges is mentally surviving
                the sudden amount of Virtual Meetings. One or two is probably fine, but being on the screen all day
                listening to Blah Blah Blah can be extremely exhausting. Some have taken liberties in their solution
                to this problem, a solution you should also consider yourself. After all, it's efficient,
                cost-effective,
                and liberating...</p>

                Work from home </h2>
            <p>You find yourself completely exhausted from virtual meetings all day. Every day. It's difficult
                to keep the work boundaries and discipline going in your home environment. Soon you start to slack
                off on 'minor' points. Who will notice it, after all?
