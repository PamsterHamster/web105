    <h1>Music:My Drug of Choice</h1>
    <h2>Go Natural.</h2>
    <p>Be healthy. Music gives me a high like cocaine or other drug stimulant, but naturally.
        Nothing beats the rush of coming off a gritty practice session, and the effects will last
        if repeated over time.

    <h2>The Science of Music</h2>
    <p>Studies have shown listening and learning music stimulates multiple areas
        of the brain in both hemispheres. The skills learned through the musical 
        process are applicable in other areas of our lives. Many famous mathmaticians
        were also serious amatuer musicians.

    <h2>Childhood</h2>
    <p>While it's never too late to put music into your life, studies have shown
        that early childhood exposure create healthy outlets for emotional and cognitive
        development.

    <h2>My Background</h2>
    <p>I grew up with more instruments in the house than furniture. Piano studies
        with my father began at age 3. I picked up the viola and violin at age 10 and
        have been playing on a professional level since my late teens. I love playing
        classical music, but also enjoy Irish, Folk, Jazz & Blues genres. My String
        Quartet, "Stratford Strings", performs regularly throughout Chicagoland.
