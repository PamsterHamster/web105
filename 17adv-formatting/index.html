        <h2>The Power of Language</h2>
        <p>
            Music was my first language, first heard (and probably understood) in the womb,
            long before I ever learned to speak. Music is a global endeavor, a universal language.
            Music was the start of my entire sense of being, of the directions I’d take in life
            and what I’d ultimately become.
        </p>
        <p>For my entire childhood I was immersed in the musical world of classical composers (aka the Dead People),
            mostly of European descent. Bach, Beethoven, Brahms, Debussy, Borodin and Ravel (to name just a few),
            have always sent me on a fascinating emotional and intellectual journey-much like being absorbed in the
            reading of a fantastic book. As a child,I had always wondered about the anthropology and circumstances
            surrounding the piano or orchestral work during its time of composition. Such questions absorbed me, such
            as:
            How were the circumstances similar or different to the current time? What did the composer’s town or village
            look like? What was the history behind the piece?
        </p>
        <p>And yet, during my various quests of both imagination and some reading of the Encyclopedia Britannica, that
            was never
            enough. I knew someday I had to travel to those places, to see them in person, to get a feel of what those
            composers may
            have experienced during their time there. I was disciplined and voracious in my musical studies as a child
            and young
            adult, and it brought me amazing opportunities. I was a little Musicologist who never got the formal
            musicology degree,
            because I had other plans…plans which seemed to evolve naturally from my other interests and
            interdisciplinary values.
        </p>
        <p>I have always had a sense of philanthropy, leadership, and marketing. Combined with my musical interests,
            this led me into Arts Management specializing in orchestras and later Linguistics (ESL/EFL), then
            International Business and Web Design learning. These areas at first might seem very disjointed from one
            another or unrelated. However,they are all tied together by language: the language of music; the language
            of learning/using a foreign language; the language of business transactions; and the language of computer
            programming and design.
        </p>
        <p>Education is a lifelong endeavor, a fundamental process which should not stop simply because you have
            accomplished a degree or certificate. Rather, it is a journey of lifelong pursuit towards your purpose
            in the Universe, or fulfilling your ultimate purpose in life. For me, this has to do with interdisciplinary
            studies, or finding the common ground among seemingly otherwise disjointed things. It is my desire to work
            together with other experts from various fields to create effective interventions and solutions across
            cultures and societies, which has the potential and power to transform the educational landscape. By
            thinking with an interdisciplinary approach, one can find their way to develop meaningful solutions to
            complex problems.
